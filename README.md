# Loan-Analysis
For this project, I used SQL for a little preliminary exploratory data analysis, then moved on to R to do a more in-depth analysis using hypothesis testing and other techniques to get a better feel for the data.
I then cleaned and processed it, and created a few models in order to see if I could predict who and who wouldn't get a loan.
I used a GLM, which produced bad results for both an ROC curve and for accuracy. I then tested a decision tree which yielded much better results.
